# Hey, I'm Andrey 👋

I'm a self-taught machine learning engineer on a mission to understand, build, and improve intelligent systems from the ground up.

I don’t rely on black-box frameworks.  
I code neural networks from scratch — to *truly* grasp what’s happening under the hood.

## 🧠 My Focus Areas

- **Neural Networks** — all kinds of networks and training logic written without high-level libraries
- **ML Diary** — daily learning logs and my own ML textbook based on the things I *find interesting*

## 🔧 Selected Projects

- 🧱 [Neural networks in Python](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/neural_networks_python): programs that I write myself or rewrite from ChatGPT/other LLM's code and study
- 📓 [ML Diary](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/001.%20ml_diary.md): notes about what I do each day I study
- 📓 [ML textbook](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/002.%20ml_textbook.md): a pile of information I found and found interesting

## 📜 Philosophy

I love artificial intelligence — not just as a tool, but as a concept.\
My goal is to help people build AGI.\
This is what drives my learning.
