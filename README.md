**Hey, I'm Andrey 👋**

I'm a self-taught machine learning engineer on a mission to understand, build, and improve intelligent systems from the ground up.\
I don’t rely on black-box frameworks.\
I code neural networks from scratch - to *truly* grasp what’s happening under the hood.
___
**🧐 My Focus Areas**

**Neural Networks** - all kinds of networks and training logic written without high-level libraries\
**ML Diary** - daily learning logs and my own ML textbook based on the things I *found interesting*
___
**🔧 Selected Projects**

🤖 [Neural networks in Python](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/neural_networks_python): programs that I write myself or rewrite from ChatGPT/other LLM's code and study\
📓 [ML Diary](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/001.%20ml_diary.md): notes about what I do each day I study\
📚 [ML textbook](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/002.%20ml_textbook.md): a pile of information I found and found interesting

💭 Philosophy

I love artificial intelligence - not just as a tool, but as a concept.\
My goal is to help people build AGI.\
This is what drives my learning.
