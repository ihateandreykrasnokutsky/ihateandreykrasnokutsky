# Hey, I'm Andrey 👋

I'm a self-taught machine learning engineer on a mission to understand, build, and improve intelligent systems from the ground up.

I don’t rely on black-box frameworks.  
I code neural networks from scratch — to *truly* grasp what’s happening under the hood.

## 🧠 My Focus Areas

- **Neural Networks** — all kinds of networks and training logic written without high-level libraries
- **Training Loops** — building forward/backward passes manually
- **ML Diary** — daily learning logs
- **Systematic Study** — writing my own ML textbook based on the things I *find interesting*

## 🔧 Selected Projects

- 🧱 [Folder programs that I wrtite and study](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/neural_networks_python): programs that I rewrite from ChatGPT/other LLM's code and study, or write myself, based on what I know
- - 📓 [ML Diary](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/001.%20ml_diary.md): notes about what I do each day I study
  - 📓 [ML textbook](https://github.com/ihateandreykrasnokutsky/my_ml_notes/blob/main/002.%20ml_textbook.md): a pile of information I found and found interesting

## 📜 Philosophy

> “I study not to prove I’m smart, but to make something smarter than I am.”

Learning ML is my craft — not just a career goal.  
I document my progress to **share**, not hoard. If you find something helpful or want to collaborate, let me know.
